        //now if talk about factorials take 5!=5*4*3*2*1=120,it have only one trailing zero because there is only one 5 and hence only one pair can be formed with 5
        //10!=10*9*8*7*6* 5!=3628800 this can be written as 10!=5*2*9*8*7*6* 5!, now we know it has two 5s(one in 5! and other as 10 =5*2) so it will have 2 trailing zeroes as two pairs can be formed
